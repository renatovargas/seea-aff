<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) is a global partnership that aims to promote sustainable development by mainstreaming Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) into development planning and ensuring that the national accounts used to measure and plan for economic growth include the value of natural capital. Different actors at global, national and subnational levels, all work towards accomplishing WAVES’ four objectives: help countries adopt and implement accounts that are relevant for policies and compile a body of experience; develop an ecosystem accounting methodology; establish a global platform for training and knowledge sharing; and build international consensus around natural capital accounting. Guatemala is one of the core implementing countries and it is involved as a pilot country in the development of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (SEEA AFF).</p>
<p>The SEEA AFF is an application of the international statistical standard SEEA 2012 Central Framework adopted in 2012 by the United Nations Statistical Commission. The SEEA AFF has the objective of examining the connection between economic activity and the environment with regards to agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities <span class="citation" data-cites="seeaaff14">[@seeaaff14]</span>. The purpose of this coverage of three different types of activity is to facilitate understanding and analysis of the trade-offs and dependencies between these activities that should be considered as part of national and local level planning.</p>
<p>Guatemala has about a decade's history in the compilation of the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts SEEA in order to develope an understanding of the interactions between the economy and the environment. The SEEA builds on top of the solid base of the System of National Accounts compiled by the Central Bank with the purpose of measuring economic performance. The Guatemalan implementation of the SEEA has developed accounts for water, forests, energy and emissions, residuals, fisheries, subsoil assets, land and ecosystems, and environmental expenditures, through a public-private effort between the academic sector and government institutions.</p>
<p>This experience has left Guatemala with appropriate conditions to focus the analytical capabilities of the SEEA on agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Furthermore, the importance of the agricultural industries in terms of employment, value added, and environmental impacts in Guatemala makes those sectors an important target for public policy. This document provides an initial aproximation to what the SEEA AFF could be in Guatemala and proposes a roadmap for its future regular compilation.</p>
<h1 id="introduction-to-the-seea-aff-objectives-domains-analytical-potential.">Introduction to the SEEA AFF (objectives, domains, analytical potential).</h1>
<p>According to the <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/aff/GC_Draft.pdf">draft manual</a>, the SEEA AFF has the objective of examining the connection between economic activity and the environment. Its scope covers agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities as defined in the <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/default.asp?Lg=3">International Standard Industrial Clasification (ISIC)</a>, section <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=A">A</a>, divisions <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=01">01</a>, <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=02">02</a> y <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=03">03</a>. The purpose of this coverage of three different types of activity is to facilitate understanding and analysis of the trade-offs and dependencies between these activities that should be considered as part of national and local level planning.</p>
<p>The draft SEEA AFF has the following data domains and base accounts:</p>
