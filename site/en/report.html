<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) is a global partnership that aims to promote sustainable development by mainstreaming Natural Capital Accounting (NCA) into development planning and ensuring that the national accounts used to measure and plan for economic growth include the value of natural capital. Different actors at global, national and subnational levels, all work towards accomplishing WAVES’ four objectives: help countries adopt and implement accounts that are relevant for policies and compile a body of experience; develop an ecosystem accounting methodology; establish a global platform for training and knowledge sharing; and build international consensus around natural capital accounting. Guatemala is one of the core implementing countries and it is involved as a pilot country in the development of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (SEEA AFF).</p>
<p>The SEEA AFF is an application of the international statistical standard SEEA 2012 Central Framework adopted in 2012 by the United Nations Statistical Commission. The SEEA AFF has the objective of examining the connection between economic activity and the environment with regards to agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities <span class="citation" data-cites="seeaaff14">[@seeaaff14]</span>. The purpose of this coverage of three different types of activity is to facilitate understanding and analysis of the trade-offs and dependencies between these activities that should be considered as part of national and local level planning.</p>
<p>Guatemala has about a decade's history in the compilation of the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts SEEA in order to develope an understanding of the interactions between the economy and the environment. The SEEA builds on top of the solid base of the System of National Accounts compiled by the Central Bank with the purpose of measuring economic performance. The Guatemalan implementation of the SEEA has developed accounts for water, forests, energy and emissions, residuals, fisheries, subsoil assets, land and ecosystems, and environmental expenditures, through a public-private effort between the academic sector and government institutions.</p>
<p>This experience has left Guatemala with appropriate conditions to focus the analytical capabilities of the SEEA on agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Furthermore, the importance of the agricultural industries in terms of employment, value added, and environmental impacts in Guatemala makes those sectors an important target for public policy. This document provides an initial aproximation to what the SEEA AFF could be in Guatemala and proposes a roadmap for its future regular compilation.</p>
<h1 id="introduction-to-the-seea-aff-objectives-domains-analytical-potential.">Introduction to the SEEA AFF (objectives, domains, analytical potential).</h1>
<p>According to the <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/aff/GC_Draft.pdf">draft manual</a>, the SEEA AFF has the objective of examining the connection between economic activity and the environment. Its scope covers agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities as defined in the <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/default.asp?Lg=3">International Standard Industrial Clasification (ISIC)</a>, section <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=A">A</a>, divisions <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=01">01</a>, <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=02">02</a> y <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=27&amp;Lg=1&amp;Co=03">03</a>. The purpose of this coverage of three different types of activity is to facilitate understanding and analysis of the trade-offs and dependencies between these activities that should be considered as part of national and local level planning.</p>
<p>The draft SEEA AFF has the following data domains and base accounts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Agricultural products and related environmental assets</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical flow account for crops</li>
<li>Physical flow account for livestock products</li>
<li>Asset account for livestock</li>
<li>Asset account for plantation crops</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Forestry products and related environmental assets</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical flow account for timber and non-wood forest products</li>
<li>Asset account for forests</li>
<li>Asset account for timber resources</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fisheries products and related environmental assets</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical flow account for fish and aquatic products</li>
<li>Asset account for fish and other aquatic resources</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Water resources</strong>
<ul>
<li>Asset account for water resources</li>
<li>Physical flow account for water abstraction</li>
<li>Physical flow account for water distribution and use</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical flow account for energy use</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Greenhouse Gas GHG emissions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical flow account for GHG emissions</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Fertilizers, nutrient flows and pesticides</strong>
<ul>
<li>Physical flow account for fertilizers</li>
<li>Nitrogen and phosphorous budgets[^1]</li>
<li>Physical flow account for pesticides</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Land</strong>
<ul>
<li>Asset account for land use</li>
<li>Asset account for land cover</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Soil resources</strong>
<ul>
<li>Asset account for soil resources</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Other economic data</strong>
<ul>
<li>Monetary supply and use table for agricultural, forestry and fisheries products</li>
<li>Extended production and income account for agricultural, forestry and fisheries activities</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>With its strong connections to the SEEA Central Framework and the SNA, the SEEA AFF brings with it the many features that these accounting based statistical frameworks provide to the organization of information and statistical activities. Important possibilities in this regard include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Conceptual framework for a database and central point for organizing data.<br />
</li>
<li>Data gap analysis and gap filling. The SEEA AFF is a broad framework designed on the information that would be most relevant rather than on the basis of the information that are currently available.</li>
<li>Data collection and reporting. As a conceptual framework SEEA AFF is able to support and encourage the use of consistent data item definitions across different collections.</li>
<li>One of the important motivations for the SEEA is to assist in the derivation of indicators that reflect cross-domain comparisons.</li>
<li>The information in the SEEA AFF can also be used to support the compilation of environmentally extended input-output tables (EE-IOT).</li>
<li>Once EE-IOT are established a range of different types of analysis may be supported, like multiplier analysis, footprint indicators, structural decomposition analysis, extended productivity analysis, modeling of international trade, general and partial equilibrium analysis, life cycle analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The design of the SEEA AFF framework supports discussion in five broad policy themes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme 1: Activity and product specific inputs: Under this theme the focus is on the analysis of the economic and environmental information about the most important products for a country and the associated trends in the use of environmental inputs and the generation of residual flows.</li>
<li>Theme 2: Food product consumption, losses and waste</li>
<li>Theme 3: Bioenergy</li>
<li>Theme 4: Use of environmental assets (timber, fisheries, water, soil).</li>
<li>Theme 5: Cross-industry and activity perspectives.</li>
<li>Other relevant policy connections.</li>
</ul>
