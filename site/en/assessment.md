# Introduction

This paper aims to provide a structure for discussion and evaluation of national capability of compiling information compliant with the SEEA-AGRI for the purpose of assessing the environmental sustainability of agriculture, forestry and fisheries.

The template starts with a number of questions about the collection and the organization of agriculture, forestry and fishing data and the relevant istitutions and their priorities.
Then, for each of the nine major data domains of the SEEA Agri, the template records a number of questions. These should allow an overview of the capability to compile the SEEA-Agri accounts.
The questions on each domain should be considered in conjunction with the  draft tables as designed by FAO staff. Questions are designed to find answers for those data that are available within a country. There is no expectation that each cell in each table is relevant to a single country or that a single agency or department could contain all the data in the scope of SEEA-Agri. Therefore, the answers to the questions require discussion and participation of agencies and experts to determine data relevance and availability.

The last set of questions is about the drawing general conclusions on the assessment process and highlight the right priorities.

The assessment template is not intended to be a substitute of a more detailed assessment of the required institutional arrangements and other factors, such as the consistency and quality of data, which should be assessed in order to determine the resources needed to implement a program of work in this area at national level. 

This evaluation template and the subsequent discussion aim to carry out within the broad implementation advice provided in the Implementation SEEA Guidelines that drafted the Statistics Division of the United Nations in 2013. This document provides a broad overview of SEEA implementation and of the general principles and steps that should be considered.


# General questions

**1.1. Agriculture and fisheries:**

* [Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA) / _Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganadería y Alimentación (MAGA)_](http://www.maga.gob.gt).
* Dirección de normatividad de la pesca y acuicultura (MAGA).

**1.2. Forestry:** 

* Forestry  National Institute  (INAB) 
* Protected Areas National Council (CONAP) 


**2. Are there publications that include data on the agriculture, forestry and fisheries? Is there a national standard or regular sets of key indicators covering environmental, forest and and fishery issues?**

* Although the National Fund for Science and Technology (Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología , FONACYT) promotes agricultural research, the country does not have a research agenda that considers the environmental sustainability of agricultural production, forestry and fisheries. 
* Research in these three areas is developed by the public sector, private sector, and some universities and NGOs.  However research is carried out without collaboration among the different institutes.
* Information on  R & D for agriculture can be found at:
http://www.asti.cgiar.org/guatemala
* The private sector conducts researches mainly on two instances:
  * [The Guatemalan Center for Sugarcane Research and Training (CENGICAÑA)](http://www.cengicana.org/en/home) was created by the Sugar Association of Guatemala (ASAZGUA) in 1992 to support the technological advancement of the sugar industry, and with the aim of improving production and productivity of sugar cane and its derivatives cultivation. The Sugarcane Center for Research and Training is funded by the mills that make the sugar industry of Guatemala.  Contributions to the budget of the Centre are offered in proportional way to the sugar output.  
  * [The Private Research Institute on Climate Change (ICC)](Http://www.icc.org.gt/?PAGE=1) mission is to develop and promote actions and processes that facilitate mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the region basing on technical and scientific guidelines."
* Even if with diminished capacity, research from the public sector is carried out by the [Agricultural Science and Technology Institute (ICTA)](http://www.icta.gob.gt/)
* The [National Institute of Forests (INAB)](http://www.inab.gob.gt/Paginas%20web/Investigacion.aspx) carries out a research program which is administered by the Department of Forest Research 
* Universities:
    * [Faculty of Agronomy of the University of San Carlos of Guatemala](http://fausac.usac.edu.gt), mainly through students' thesis.
    * [Institute of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment (IARNA)](http://www.infoiarna.org.gt/) of Rafael Landivar University (URL, that has led the work on the [System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA)](http://www.infoiarna.org.gt/index.php/cuentas-ambientales). 
* This system has been formalized and it is being used to take into account information on natural resources in making economic decisions. This effort is led by the Ministry of Planning and Programming of the Presidency (SEGEPLAN) in collaboration with the Bank of Guatemala (BANGUAT)), the Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) and the National Institute of Statistics (INE). The IARNA provides all technical support to this effort. This activity is part of the initiative [Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES)](https://www.wavespartnership.org/).

# Summary

## Conclusions 

**a. What are the main areas of current policy focus in relation to sustainable agriculture, forestry and fisheries production?**

* The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food (MAGA) has prioritized six strategic objectives that can justify the SEEA-Agri.
  * Generate, process and disseminate geographic, cartographic, food safety and risk management information for the development of contingency plans, prevention and mitigation of damage caused by natural disasters as well as the registration and control of the Territorial State Reserve Areas.
  * Implement the Policy on Food and Nutrition Security, coordinating programs and projects that help to mitigate the effects of recurrent natural disasters and socio economic crisis by providing food; and promote required production for the applicant and served population.
  * To promote community capacity and organization by fostering the production, processing and marketing through productive projects, reactivating rural economy and increasing productivity to achieve rural economic development.
  * Strengthen agricultural and rural financial system, through the creation of mechanisms that encourage strategic investments in rural areas.
  * Give clear and stable rules for the sustainable use of agricultural productive assets, natural resources and unprocessed food safety.
  * Build capacity to strengthen the institutions in the field of agriculture, strengthening the organization, expanding the extension  coverage and by  training, technical assistance and training of human resources and technological innovation, with methodological and instrumental tools to adapt, according areas and conditions of production units.

**b. What are the main areas in which data are available to fill the SEEA- Agri accounts?**

  * Base line and first update for the seea-guatemala have been  compiled by iarna and officialized  by the ine. Specific information has been supplied on: forest, fish and aquiculture, water, and soil and ecosystems.

**c. What gaps need to be filled to meet the data basic requirements for the main areas of policy focus?**

* Unify information systems and administrative records of the country. 
* Check the quality of the data produced. 
* Plan and direct the statistical towards the SEEA-Agri and relevant indicators for the national agricultural policy.


## Opportunities, obstacles and next steps

**a. What are progress opportunities for the development of these data? Consider both national and international initiatives and political and analytical statistics.**

* There is a growing interest for international cooperation and national statistical systems strengthening food security and nutrition. Especially for disaggregated production at household level.
* Operationally, statistical development can be improved by two main tools:
  * Surveys of the Zero Hunger Program (Programa Hambre Cero) that takes place in 166 of the 338 municipalities.
  * With support from IARNA funding from USAID, INE has formed the "Industrial Statistics Coordinating Office for Food Security and Nutrition (OCSE-SAN)", which is formed by over 20 public agencies producing data at the national level.

**b. What are the main obstacles to data expansion and coverage? This could include capacity / statistics skills, institutional arrangements, funding and computing environments, etc.**

* The National Institute of Statistics (INE) needs to be reonforced technically, as well as financially, in order to ensure constant quality data production.

**c. What are the next steps that could be taken to work in SEEA Agri and for the general improvement of agricultural statistics?**

* Suggest to current authorities to boost INE satellite accounts.

* As part of a donation of USAID to INE, the implementation of a satellite account of food and nutrition security (or agricultural, depending on the technical discussions that have not yet been completed).

* Boost the SEEA AFF initiative with the institutions (SEGEPLAN, BANGUAT, INE) supported by IARNA. There is a team of officials and technical high level that could establish the "institutional agricultural-environmental audit committee".

* Support INE in becoming part of the Global Agricultural and Rural Development Statistical Initiative.
